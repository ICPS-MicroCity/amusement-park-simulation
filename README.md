# MicroCity - Amusement Park Simulation

This repository contains an [Alchemist](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Alchemist) simulation of guests in an amusement park. The aim is to check whether a situated activity-recommendation system would positively affect the park or not.

Please, check the [domain analysis repository](https://github.com/ICPS-MicroCity/domain-analysis) to better understand what a *MicroCity* is and what this work is about.

This repository was built using the [Alchemist Primer Template](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/alchemist-primer).

### Execution

To run the simulation you need `Java >= 17` installed on your machine.

You can launch the simulation by running:

```
./gradlew runSimulation
```

or, if you are on Windows:

```
gradle.bat runSimulation
```

To run the simulation in batch mode, you need to change the `batch` property to `true` inside the `gradle.properties` file.
