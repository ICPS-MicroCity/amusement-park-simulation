# MicroCity - Amusement Park Simulation

This repository contains an [Alchemist](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Alchemist) simulation of guests in an amusement park. The aim is to check whether a situated activity-recommendation system would positively affect the park or not.

Please, check the [domain analysis repository](https://github.com/ICPS-MicroCity/domain-analysis) to better understand what a *MicroCity* is and what this work is about.

This repository was built using the [Alchemist Primer Template](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/alchemist-primer).
